This is because of the way Word2Vec is computing the similarity between word vectors in the embedding space. Although the word vectors closest to a given word vector are almost certainly going to have similar meaning or connotation with our given word, the word vectors that the model considers 'least similar' are just the word vectors that are farthest away, or have the lowest cosine similarity. It's important to understand that while the closest vectors in the embedding space will almost certainly share some level of semantic meaning with a given word, there is no guarantee that this relationship will hold at large distances. \n","\n","We can also get the vector for a given word by passing in the word as if we were passing in a key to a dictionary. \n","\n","In the cell below, get the word vector for `'Texas'`."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"9iww398T5x1A","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["wv['Texas']"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fHb93BkT5x1C","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Let's get all of the word vectors from the object at once.

However, for the small amount of training data it was given, the model still performs remarkably well! \n","\n","We'll see in the next lab that from a practical standpoint, one of the best things we can do for performance is to start by loading in the weights from an open-sourced model that has been trained for a very long time on a massive amount of data, such as the GloVe model from the Stanford NLP Group. There's not really any benefit from training the model ourselves, unless our text uses different, specialized vocabulary that isn't likely to be well represented inside an open-source model.\n","\n","## Summary\n","\n","In this lab, we learned how to train and use a Word2Vec model to created vectorized word embeddings!"]}]}
